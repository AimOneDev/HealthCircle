# health_circle

A new Flutter project.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

So many people out there think so much about the fact that we could use technology to actually save lives, and this is what we have actually adopted in the whole concept of the idea of the app from the very beginning, the app has a feature called "emergency" which could be voice activated in case a person can’t reach their phone when an accident of any sort happens but it could still be reachable by using a smart tapping mode too, another base feature that the app is based on is holding the entire medical record of the person who has a profile in the app, these medical records can be reached by the emergency team to know exactly if the patient has any sort of pre healed or ongoing diseases that may make saving that person’s life way much easier and knowing how to handle their case and deal with it fast. 
Then there is the premium ship subscription which has 2 main features and those are called : Health Feed and Your Live Doctor, the health feed will hold special health tips for the person who has the profile in the app and provide them with special tips that are made especially for them by special doctors. And the last feature of “your live doctor” is a special one in which you can speak directly through video streaming or video call and discuss any problem live with a doctor whom you can book a test session with right through the app too. 
So this is what HealthCircle is, a special app that help save lives using the latest technologies even machine learning to make the app made special for each individual user.
